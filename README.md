Web communities depend on open forums for tasks like governance, information sharing, and decision-making, but these can yield biased outcomes. In Wikipedia's Articles for Deletion (AfD) discussions, biographies of women face faster deletion nominations, longer consensus times, and are more often redirected or merged into menâ€™s biographies, highlighting gender asymmetries. Our study applies both survival analysis and a competing risk framework to examine the role of Articles for Deletion (AfD) in Wikipediaâ€™s gender gap, offering insights for the governance of open knowledge platforms. Our paper describing this work is available on [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.04340).

## Steps to follow
1. Clone the project repository.
```
    git clone https://github.com/CSDL-UMD/Survival-of-the-Notable-in-Wikipedia.git
```    

2. Create requirment.txt file
```
    make create_requirement
```
3. Then create virtual environment
```
    make create_environment
```
4. Download raw datasets from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15259030). Then unzip "data.zip" and place the contents into this project folder. 

(Optional) Steps to build dataset from scratch:
If you want to extract raw dataset and store in folders "data/raw" and "data/petscan", follow the [Manual](docs/docs/index.md). 
    

5. Then, using Python scripts, prepare dataset for survival analysis 
```
    make data
```
This script will prepare datasets for: a) Kaplan-Meier estimation, b) Cox proportional hazards model analysis, and c) Competing Risk model. All the outputs will be stored in folder "data/interim" (for retrospective analysis) and "data/processed" (for the rest).

6. Then, using R scripts, employ competing risk model (both Multi-state and Single-state models) and create visualization
```
    make compete_risk
```
The report will be stored in file "reports/figures/Fig5-All_models.pdf".

7. Then, using R scripts, prepare dataset for retrospective analysis
```
    make retrospective_data
```
All the outputs will be stored in "data/processed".


8. Finally, to explore and visualize the results of the survival analysis and competing risk models, use the notebook: "Survival Analysis.ipynb". All the visualizations will be stored in folder "reports/figures/".
