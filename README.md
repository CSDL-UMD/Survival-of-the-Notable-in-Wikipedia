Web communities depend on open forums for tasks like governance, information sharing, and decision-making, but these can yield biased outcomes. In Wikipedia's Articles for Deletion (AfD) discussions, biographies of women face faster deletion nominations, longer consensus times, and are more often redirected or merged into menâ€™s biographies, highlighting gender asymmetries. Our study applies both survival analysis and a competing risk framework to examine the role of Articles for Deletion (AfD) in Wikipediaâ€™s gender gap, offering insights for the governance of open knowledge platforms. Our paper describing this work is available on [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.04340).

## Steps to follow
1. Clone the project repository.

2. Create requirment.txt file
```
    make create_requirement
```
3. Then create virtual environment
```
    make create_environment
```
4. Download raw datasets from Zenodo, which is currently under community review.

(Optional) Steps to build dataset from scratch:
If you want to extract raw dataset and store in folders "raw" and "petscan", follow the [Manual](docs/docs/index.md). 
    

5. Then prepare dataset
```
    make data
```
All the outputs will be stored in folder "data/processed".

6. Then prepare dataset for retrospective analysis
```
    make retrospective_data
```
All the outputs will be stored in folder "data/interim" and "data/processed".


7. To explore and visualize the results of the survival analysis, refer to the notebook: "Survival Analysis.ipynb". All the visualizations will be stored in folder "reports/figures/".

8. To model competing risk (both Multi-state and Single-state models) and create visualization
```
    make compete_risk
```
The report will be stored in file "reports/figures/Fig5-All_models.pdf".
